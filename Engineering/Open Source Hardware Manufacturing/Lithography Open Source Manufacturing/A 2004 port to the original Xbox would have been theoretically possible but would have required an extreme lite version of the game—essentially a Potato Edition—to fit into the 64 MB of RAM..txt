A 2004 port to the original Xbox would have been theoretically possible but would have required an extreme "lite" version of the game—essentially a "Potato Edition"—to fit into the 64 MB of RAM.

2004 port to original xbox with pentium III 733 MHz cpu processor could this be done theoretically given that people played wow 2004 with 450 mhz or less processors

Theoretically, a port of
World of Warcraft
(2004) to the original Xbox is much more feasible than a PS2 port because the Xbox
was essentially a specialized PC, though it would still face significant memory challenges.
1. CPU: 733 MHz vs. 450 MHz
The original Xbox’s custom Intel Pentium III "Coppermine" at 733 MHz is technically sufficient for the core game logic. 

    The 450 MHz Myth: While some players "ran" WoW on 450 MHz Pentium III systems in 2004, the experience was often unplayable (1–10 FPS).
    Official Minimums: Blizzard’s official minimum requirement was 800 MHz, but the Xbox's fixed hardware allowed for lower-level optimizations that could bridge the 67 MHz gap to the 733 MHz CPU. 

2. The Real Barrier: 64 MB RAM
The CPU is not the bottleneck; the RAM is.

    WoW 2004 PC Minimum: 256 MB RAM.
    Original Xbox RAM: Only 64 MB of shared DDR memory.
    The Memory Problem: Even with the Xbox’s efficient "fixed" architecture, 64 MB is not enough to store the assets of a major city like Ironforge or Stormwind. A port would require massive downgrades to texture quality, view distance, and the number of players visible on screen simultaneously. 

3. Comparison: Xbox vs. PS2 Port
An Xbox port is technically "closer" to possible than the PS2 for three reasons:

    DirectX Support: The Xbox was built on a modified DirectX 8.0 API. Since WoW was a DirectX 9.0 game, the code would be far easier to port to Xbox than to the PS2's unique, non-PC architecture.
    Shared Memory: Unlike the PS2’s split memory (32MB main / 4MB video), the Xbox used a unified memory architecture where all 64MB was available to both the CPU and GPU.
    Internal Storage: The Xbox featured a built-in Hard Drive (8GB or 10GB), which was required for WoW’s massive 4GB install size. The PS2 required an expensive, separate HDD add-on. 

Summary Verdict
A 2004 port to the original Xbox would have been theoretically possible but would have required an extreme "lite" version of the game—essentially a "Potato Edition"—to fit into the 64 MB of RAM. It likely would have resembled the "slideshow" experience of low-end 450 MHz PCs rather than a smooth console experience.
