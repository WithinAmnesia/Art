So it turns out that this invented holiday of mine to bridge the gap from Halloween and Christmas 'Hallowmas' https://www.deviantart.com/withinamnesia/art/Hallowmas-27-November-Spirits-Past-Celebration-896502516 on the 27th of November (mid point between Halloween and Christmas) lines up pretty well with American thanksgiving on like mid-late 20's of November. So it would make sense to have like an amalgamation / combination of the two like how there is Christmas Eve. Or like how there is Boxing day with Christmas where it is kind of like ~3 holidays Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day. It could be something like that in November but near the end of it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving is kind of a turkey shoot in terms of a set day but Halloween and Christmas are sets dates.

Thanksgiving
Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in the United States, Canada, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Liberia. It began as a day of giving thanks and sacrifice for the blessing of the harvest and of the preceding year. Similarly named festival holidays occur in Germany, and Japan. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday ...
I got this idea of a rolling holiday from how stores and business operate from how they stock the stores. Halloween morphs into Christmas pretty much.
Also there was this cheap holiday chocolate for Halloween that was wrapped in tin foil with a cat or a witch or a pumpkin on it but the chocolate was shaped as santa claus so the company could have 2 chocolate mold and use it for Halloween and Christmas.
I just figure if the two are going to be conjoined anyway it might as well have a cool holiday that is like a Franken Claus of the two.
