"The gist of my message was an adaptor for GDscript that runs in ReX to dump in GDscript and have a project work (even with losses) although side RDscript / C++ / C# code base / scripts can help people / teams be productive for a 1/2 ~50-51% ~D Grade working prototype is a lot more reasonable to give to a team to be like 'eh this could use a patch / code translation' vs. okay its 0/1~25-40%  F to E Grade broken not working and its your job to get it working good luck x.x.
