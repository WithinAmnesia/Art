Canada Mountain Western Lowland 'Highland' Hybrid Gorilla

"Prompt: can mountain gorillas have children with western lowland gorilla? can 512+ gorilla population be born from mainly western low land gorillas and minorly mountain gorillas?

Yes, mountain gorillas (
Gorilla beringei beringei) and western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) can theoretically have offspring, although they are distinct subspecies (and sometimes classified as separate species) that rarely meet in the wild. They are closely enough related to interbreed, potentially resulting in a healthy intermediate hybrid. 
Regarding the population question, a population of 512+ gorillas can absolutely be formed from a majority of western lowland gorillas with minor mountain gorilla ancestry. In fact, this scenario—a large population with a small amount of introgression from another group—is common in captive settings and, historically, in the wild. 
Here is a breakdown of the details:

    Interbreeding (Hybridization): Mountain gorillas and western lowland gorillas are considered separate subspecies (part of different species in some classifications) that diverged long ago. While they do not meet in the wild due to geographic separation (thousands of miles) and different habitats, they can breed in captivity.
    Genetic Admixture: Genetic studies have shown that captive gorillas, in particular, are often highly admixed, meaning they are a mix of different wild-born populations. It is entirely possible for a managed or captive population (such as one with 512+ individuals) to be predominantly western lowland while containing minor, or even significant, genetic traces from Eastern or mountain gorillas due to historical interbreeding.
    Population Viability: A 512+ population is well within the realm of possibility for a managed population (e.g., in a large habitat or captive breeding program). Western lowland gorillas are far more numerous than mountain gorillas.
    Challenges: While they can breed, the offspring might face challenges if the parents have vastly different adaptations (e.g., high-altitude cold vs. low-altitude rainforest), but in a controlled environment, such a population is viable. 

In summary, a 512+ population of mixed western lowland and minor mountain gorilla descent is genetically possible, especially in captivity, as they are capable of interbreeding." -Google AI
