So apparently I was drafted / tried to be recruited for WW2 at 4 AM. Like I woke up and was like Yes! as I do from a dead sleep / waking up and it was this guy outside my room, Not Cole asking to go to work but like different asking about the bombing raids again how they are short staffed and need combat pilots foe the last batch was wiped out trying to get to brandenburg. I think it was the Soviet union or something in the later half of ww2 like 1944 or something. I was like was major domensko off leave? major inankochuk or something was like ahh odessa right, (later on near the end I remember) I was like bring in the rear guards and show they around the north, use the good stiff it gets a bit prickly over the baltics at night / storm. Right right sire. Still need me? No I don't think I'll telegram domensko for the rear air wing. Okay. Then I went back to bed. Strange. I think it was a sort of dream.

One night I dreamt that I was talking to my dad like right outside his bedroom and I was asking if Debbie my step mom was going to sleep sitting up and I was like I know she likes to lay down and sleep but will she sit up?
My dad in my dream was confused at the fuckery coming out of my mouth and it was not making sense in my head even in the dream

Viktor Dudnichenko was born on May 25, 1923 in the village of Novomalinovka, now the Shirokovsky district of the Dnepropetrovsk region, into a peasant family. After graduating from the 7th grade of an incomplete secondary school, he worked as a tractor driver on a collective farm in the Krivoy Rog district of the Dnepropetrovsk region. In 1941 he was drafted into the Red Army and a year later he graduated from the Chuguev Military Aviation Pilot School.

From April 1943 on the fronts of the Great Patriotic War, he fought on the La-5 fighter.

By January 1944, the deputy squadron commander of the 239th Fighter Aviation Regiment (235th Fighter Aviation Division, 10th Fighter Aviation Corps, 2nd Air Army, 1st Ukrainian Front) Senior Lieutenant V. M. Dudnichenko made more than 120 sorties, conducted 26 air battles, in which he personally shot down 16 enemy aircraft.

In the autumn of 1944, the plane of Viktor Dudnichenko was shot down over the Carpathians, where the Germans were still in charge. Hiding from persecution, the pilot crossed the front line after 3 days and carried out a wounded soldier - A. Tubolkin from the front line.
Viktor Dudnichenko ended the war as part of the 181st Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment. In the summer of 1944, our pilots fought tense air battles in the foothills of the Carpathians. Enemy aircraft in this area showed particular activity. Armadas of bombers constantly rushed to Stanislav. On some days, 100 or more Junkers arrived. German fighters operated, as a rule, only in small groups - they conducted "air hunting". I had to be alert day and night.

Once, our pilots, having arrived from a combat mission, went to the dining room. Suddenly two Messers appeared, intending to attack our column heading towards the front. Viktor Dudnichenko, leaving the dining table, was the first to lift the car into the air and went to intercept enemy fighters. His La-5 boldly attacked the leader of the enemy pair and shot him down. The second plane hastened to escape. It was far from the only victory of the brave pilot in the Carpathian sky. On July 1, 1944, for courage and courage shown in battles with enemies, Viktor Dudnichenko was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.
By the end of the war, the brave fighter pilot made about 180 successful sorties and brought the number of his air victories to 22.

After the war, Viktor Markovich continued to serve in the Air Force. In 1947 he graduated from military flight and tactical courses of the Air Force. Since 1955, Guards Lieutenant Colonel V. M. Dudnichenko has been in reserve. Lived and worked in the city of Izmail, Odessa region. He was awarded the Orders of Lenin (twice), the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree (twice), and medals. Secondary school No. 5 in the city of Krivoy Rog bears his name.

Cranberrlee ‚Äî 28/07/2022 10:51

You didn‚Äôt get his right name wrong so it seems something is fuzzy (edited)

[10:57]
Maybe something crossed

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 10:57
in the iron curtain?
[10:58]
I don't think its physical.

Cranberrlee ‚Äî 28/07/2022 10:58
If he was real and a real ghost

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 10:58

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 10:59
I was giving commands for Dudnichenko to some military office guy.
[10:59]
in the dream.
[10:59]
it was assumed I had combat pilot experience by the guy talking to myself or talking through my door.

Cranberrlee ‚Äî 28/07/2022 10:59
Well maybe your brain manifested it‚Äôs own version

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 10:59
yeah
[11:00]
but
[11:00]
to nail all those little things perfectly is just...
[11:01]
the time, date, rank, name, field, service, war, town, theatre, combat experience, ethnicity, all so causally too

Cranberrlee ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:01
I mean you could chalk it up to you have been rebirthed many times and your just getting flash images
[11:02]
But I don‚Äôt believe in rebirth per day lol so my mind goes for the more rational

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:02
well I like rational and logical

Cranberrlee ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:02
Our brains like to make sense out of things
[11:03]
Even when there‚Äôs no real sense but we do it cause we just have to our maybe we‚Äôll explode lol

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:03
yeah mate

Cranberrlee ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:03
But

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:03
that one was not even that much either

Cranberrlee ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:04
It‚Äôs hard to tell with this because you said you were awake but you don‚Äôt hallucinate out side of your dreams?

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:04
its hard to say

Cranberrlee ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:04
You had to still be asleep

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:04
I think
[11:04]
it felt like
[11:04]
almost
[11:04]
when you 'fake get out of bed'
[11:05]
and you wake up still in bed but different kinda
[11:05]
my room was dark and the guy was at my door behind it like it was late at night
[11:06]
the door sounded a lot more sturdier when he rapped it / knocked on it too.
[11:07]
its just strange

Cranberrlee ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:08
For sure, very peculiar lol (edited)
[11:10]
Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt cole or someone else in the house?
[11:10]
Maybe they had a ever interesting conversation with your dream mind

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:10
Also if he was a major in the airforce then who was I? I was giving orders for multiple fronts as well. Like the air campaign over germany.

Cranberrlee ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:11
I don‚Äôt have anything to try and explain that one lol

Matthew ‚Äî 28/07/2022 11:12
theres only like 5 or 3 above that
[11:12]
Lieutenant colonel (can't order are units around, just there local forces they are attached to)
[11:12]
Colonel same thing but like its like a whole air wing
[11:13]
like all of the south ukraine airforce would be lead by a Colonel but commanded where to go by either
[11:14]
