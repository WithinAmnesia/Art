Baldurkai 'Baldrick's Eye'

Baldurkai.

This improved prototype additional continent design for my AGABAL planet world RPG setting universe (designed with inkarnate.com ). Baldurkai as a name is a rough Sumerian Bastardization BADUR = Water, KIA = Earth (~Water Isles). Further Vulgarization of ~'Baldrick's Eye'.

This continent is a combination of a meteorite, aftermath of a massive eruption and the resulting caldera. The land newly formed and rich with precious minerals. The epicenter is rife with potent minerals, war is brewing over the finding of trace amounts of Mithril running from the mountain streams. The war is in-part fueled by the Mithril Rush.
