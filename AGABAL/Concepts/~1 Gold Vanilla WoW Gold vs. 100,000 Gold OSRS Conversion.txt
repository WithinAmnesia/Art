Hourly profit table

Note: Most money making methods rely on Grand Exchange item prices WITHOUT the tax in place, which may fluctuate as players constantly sell for higher or lower than the listed price, and some items are less stable than others. For methods involving the processing of items, it is recommended to test each method with a small sample size before investing a lot of money, as the prices may not be fully accurate, possibly resulting in loss instead of profit.
