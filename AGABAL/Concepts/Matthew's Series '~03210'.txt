hey like I want you to think like how everyone else thinks, like just because you are good does not stop bad people from hurting you too. So I hope to checkup on your ability to like see what goes on in the dark to so its like you have a better time and not be used a donkey pulling someone's gravy train you know? (edited)
[07:22]
donkeys are nice don't ask questions work long hours and avoid confrontation and want to be comfortable all the time. (edited)
[07:23]
So like I try myself to not be the donkey from my experience.
[07:24]
government jobs have a lot of slavedrivers in middle management because of the guaranteed money and no work.
[07:24]
anywhere in the world too.
[07:26]
traditionally how thats solved is knowing people pretty much but its a quagmire of swamp mhmmmmm you are too nice for all of that too like I don't see you not paying people to pay yourself more and lying too. like also if you are a 'good leader' the bad leaders will gang up on you to push you out to keep their jobs cus it reveals their game if you do that job fairly mhmm (edited)
[07:27]
thats why there are cliques and groups and shady stuff too its like 'kept in house / in the family' mhmmmm

Matthew — Today at 07:28
I guess your new spot is supposed to still be on the ground floor right?
[07:28]
you don't get stuck in the management offices?
[07:29]
managers don't deal with the public too right? just in management offices and sometimes on the work floor to pretend to work or do very basic stuff?

Pohnani — Today at 07:34
They might deal with some public

Matthew — Today at 07:34
I wonder if you got screwed from working at home because the managers were being lazy had a bunch of shadow staff (their family) and got busted then big sweeping rules target the managers but its the staff really that get punished but the rules don't work for the managers for they are in on it and have a zero 0 day solution loophole or just dont care too and continue on their merry game and like if it was a staffer who brought up the fuss the sweeping rule could be used to push down their staff / donkeys / slaves to not 'act up' too and it hits you being good and its not random either these things are calculated too, its hard work being corrupt and not working lol the whole job is messing up everyone and making it look like you are doing what you should and hiding that you are not working and gaming the system and you put your real time in gaming the system and punishing 'whistle blowers' too.
[07:37]
also ever ask why the staff needs to get screened too like if they don't management can put anyone in there and park them and just write in their hours and keep that salary to themselves they need a skeleton crew to look like they need money and are working (you) and they always say its not enough to go around their whole career is scamming and lying and cheating so good luck trying to convince them to 'be good' you gotta play the game or at least know the game to counter them as well.
[07:37]
salary is not hourly too you said so thats easy pickings
[07:38]
I bet management would fire you in a heart beat if you asked for an audit to show who gets paid what in public to make sure the public money is legal.
[07:40]
I bet you don't even know who gets paid what in the entire wing and never ran a shadow audit yourself to check the official version and reality and compare the two to find the truth for you are so nice as well.
[07:40]
Yet why would you?
[07:40]
They whole thing is not good at the top.
[07:41]
So like maybe deep down you know this but you need stability as well.

Matthew — Today at 07:42
Maybe you don't want to be a real 'leader' there you know but like stay on the donkey staff floor too for you know the staff are good but management is bad, for every story you tell me I presume there are 10 stories not told 100 weird cases and 1000 strange events you either noticed or did not find too.
[07:43]
Maybe there are no real leaders there?

Pohnani — Today at 07:43
Lol your such a dick

Matthew — Today at 07:43
You never said stories of you paying the pice to be a good leader too Ashley.

Pohnani — Today at 07:43
I’m out of here 

Matthew — Today at 07:43
Stay here I have a story to tell you.
[07:44]
Its about being good in a bad world.
[07:44]
Also its about being a good leader which you say you want to be too.
[07:45]
being good cost the most to do personally inside and out
[07:45]
I fight a lot as you know
[07:45]
I fight to help people and stop bad people too
[07:46]
this puts me at constant odds with bad people

Pohnani — Today at 07:46
No this is you just trying to take me down

Matthew — Today at 07:46
Are you sure?

Pohnani — Today at 07:46
Didn’t I just fucking tell this to you yesterday?
[07:47]
And you want to just be the same way
[07:47]
Am I a fool?
[07:47]
I guess so
[07:47]


Matthew — Today at 07:47
Ashley [M. Corbin]
[07:47]
come here like
[07:47]
I'm not being mean or like I want to like show you these things that help myself help people
[07:48]
What is it this time?
[07:49]
I bumped into something you are sensitive with?

@Pohnani
Lol your such a dick

Matthew — Today at 07:49
thats not a bad thing too also in ways.
[07:49]
its like a balance too
[07:50]
if I'm to hard on you its not helping make the things better its just a lot then too
[07:52]
if I'm too nice or afraid to express my feelings you risk to end up like me being an abused donkey or at worst a good leader pulled down by bad leaders like I'm a very ferocious person too like for good reason as well like I sorta had to be to power through so many bad 'leaders' / people using my good to like overpower the bad people but its hard on myself as well.
[07:56]
I want to teach you like super valuable life experience on being a good leader who thrives but like you gotta be tough too like I love you so I try my best to be nice as possible but some people just are fake too and they are 'over nice' but abuse you in the end for they were never 'nice' they just knew how to play the game mhmm. So leading is hard to be a good person with too its very easy to be a bad leader lol but choosing to be loyal to ~good is the most powerful usually.

@Pohnani
No this is you just trying to take me down

Matthew — Today at 07:57
Is this the reason for you acting up?
[07:58]
I brought up insecurities you don't want to confront right now?

Matthew

was it this big ass thing was there a big saddness in here some where or something the cuts deep?

@Pohnani
Am I a fool?

Matthew — Today at 07:59
Why do you bite yourself?

@Pohnani
I guess so

Matthew — Today at 08:03
Did I reveal something you did not think of before it hurt and also think you are less valuable because you feel yourself and or myself to see you in ways where (somehow according to yourself) you are not valuable because you under perform or are not enough to do well in an area and get punished by this? Like I feel this is your insecurity thing somehow like you never bite me and yourself being like la la happy time its only when like you get hurt then you lash out in pain feeling hurt too. Its all related and has a source for everything too.
[08:05]
You run away and bite yourself and me like trying to not feel bad about yourself too. Like when have you ever really like bit me really hard as like a plan you know? I have not done that to you and you (I think) know this inside and out so you trust me and like you don't bite me as a plan you love me deep down like I love you too Ashley. (edited)
[08:06]
I'm sorry if I was not gentle and too rough too I like want you to b e treated well too, I'm not at your work to help you too so I worry you get hurt by bad people like I got hurt before.

Matthew — Today at 08:14
You are like lalala me be good everything be good ya lalala (like I used to do) then like you might have hella corrupt people you will end up fighting too. Maybe thats why you got the job in the first place cus the in fighting and upper management does not leave the lower donkey leaves; usually unless its a big fight (my life experience I was the donkey lots who actually beat the slavedriver so you are lucky you even know me I am RARE because like no one survives being a ring leader in coup without winning the game to knowing how to not lose as well). I have rebelled a lot as you know but you become target number 1 as a good leader you guide the good people in the dark and bad people see you and target you and they try to fight dirty as well so you gotta burn hotter to fight them back and win too, if you fall all the people following you get devoured by the bad people in the shadows; you only know that when you see it happen as well. What monster wants another rebellion against their corruption(?); no one does thus if you rebel and fall all of your followers get eat alive if they are not strong enough to fight back which most are not because they sought your power and fire to guide them in the darkness. Good beats evil but you gotta one tough bastard to survive and a juggernaut to thrive. (edited)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggernaut
Juggernaut
A juggernaut ( (listen)), in current English usage, is a literal or metaphorical force regarded as merciless, destructive, and unstoppable. This English usage originated in the mid-nineteenth century and was adapted from the Sanskrit word Jagannath.


Matthew — Today at 08:26
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagannath#Etymology
Jagannath
Jagannath (Odia: ଜଗନ୍ନାଥ, romanized: Jagannātha, lit. 'Lord of the Universe'; formerly English: Juggernaut) is a deity worshipped in regional Hindu traditions in India and Bangladesh as part of a triad along with his brother Balabhadra, and sister, Subhadra. Jagannath, within Odia Hinduism, is the supreme god, Purushottama, and the Para Brahman....

[08:29]
So I looked up the word Juggernaut and its like derived from the hindu Jagannath 'lord of the universe' and the negative side was over portrayed by messed up western missionaries and like the origin of the word and typical meaning of 'Juggernaut. In reality Jagannath has creation and destruction so a true Juggernaut / Jagannath embodiment has creation and destruction and has responsibility of the universe around them and is an uniting force of preservation of positive things.

[09:07]
well good news I figured out the container thing yesterday too ya. (edited)

Matthew — Today at 09:14
I came upon to start the modular expandable home to get 8 x 40 foot long tall cube shipping containers and use 2 rows of 4 in a stack starting with the basement and use the long expansion side to house the ~20 start section half and end up with each level having 3x8x40 plus a half or more of the last section of 8x20+ and a side stair access door way to the roof so it ends up with (~3.5x(8x40)=1,120+ square feet of usuable space per level which hits a human target of 'a lot of space' and there are 2 inside levels and roof.
[09:19]
My brother just stopped in and I forgot to mention yesterday that he says that the red truck the shocks are basically messed up they need to be fixed there's a new little welder down at Scott's place but like it needs to do like a lot of work and it's like I just don't want to do it to be honest and like the one like 2 to 300 bucks but like they're not mentioning how difficult this thing is going to be to do and like I need the money and not but not I just don't need any of that so I just like I said I don't guess I say I don't need the money then cuz the needs like a more powerful word so that I want the money but I don't need that there goes by the way so yeah so my brother came here on my door and knocked and it's like hey you want to work on this and I was like didn't say anything but I said like maybe I'll head down there but like I just don't want to work on that thing cuz it's just I don't work on new things with no future. I aim towards working for new Futures new things that do good things don't have just shitty fucking like life attached to them somehow so like I just you know want a new start and also I'm just not into having like repairs you know I don't want to work on repairs I'll work on construction manufacturing new things so I'll just you know a MIG welder and also I've done that before but I just I just don't want to do that anymore and I just don't care I don't care if I don't care what the money I don't care about this it's just that I need I said I want to work on my game today you know and that's what I want to do it's like you know it's like this money it doesn't really work because like even if it was like a thousand bucks or something like that you know or like it's just the amount of hassle involved in like if that's a precedent I don't want to be repaired person you know I want to be a person who makes things and like I think maybe say no to this I'll maybe find better ways to do things like say yes to (edited)

I made chocolate vanilla nutrient protein powder oatmeal and I took some multivitamins and a bunch of omega fish oil and all that jazz so it's healthy breakfast I suppose and like now this got used to eating healthier stuff and like I still eat chocolate stuff all the time just like when I have I don't know I'm not saving up for something I need to go get to make my skills better to actually leverage more power in my life I you know I buy food like me or you know yogurts eggs maybe some other stuff like that just but this really inexpensive and healthy food it's just you know lots of flavor to it it's fine but you got used to it pretty much and just it makes me healthier as well so it takes a bit of discipline though but that's that's okay it's not like not taste either it's not like I can't eat like Bland ass Foods I just can't do it so it's been expensive the protein powder or less if I use like make it so it's like doesn't taste bad but it's also good but like it also it's kind of hard to prepare because like it's a so like the son of the mixtures are a bit difficult to pull off because you need like a certain amount of certain amount of cocoa powder a certain amount of this and that if you get the mixture wrong it doesn't quite work properly but there's a certain like yeah so you can you can change the problem from like expensive and like doesn't taste good to like make it you know very precise kind of but also it's cheap easy fast and lazy but you have to be like a little bit of skill and then it's really good

Some are reprints of older faerun D&D sets too.

Matthew — Today at 10:28
1,000 / 16 = 62.5 on average with some promotional art being combination or like big pieces too so it probably closer to 64 each but hard to say. Bonus burgers for sure. The triforce has a bonus burger in the center 3 triangles a free one, 8 squares in a box ghride like tik tak have a bonus burgher in the center free on. Castles built with 4 walls 4 corners have a middle bonus burger. a triforce of triforces or a cube of cubes has a super bonus burger where you get a whole entire first one for free by good planning. I call this visual math but it applies to more than geotry lol. Matthew Law of bonus burgers, Matthew's Emporium University of Bonus Burgers ya.
[10:31]
there are burnt burgers when you waste resources and there are bitch burgers if its a small burger there are regular burgers and there are big burgers not quite a bonus then there are bonus burgers then big bonus burgers and super bonus burgers and super big bonus burgers then omega bonus burgers like 4d time to then beyond 5d to 6d bonus burgers of 5d potential and 6d metapotential.

Matthew — Today at 11:13
The "~03210" series is my series and also a short hand for the Mandelbrot Set (the ~'god' number) in that we have:
the first number in my series is '0' is the void surrounding and boundaries
the second number in my series is '3' is the three big connected dots on the mail line
the third number in my series is '2' are the extra big two dots on the top and bottom the biggest dot that are both larger than the third smallest connected dot of the 3 dots on the main line
the forth number in series is '1' is the small dot on the mail line not connected to the 3 main dots but is a small version of the big connected dots in the center that is sort of independent in ways or in the distance
the fifth number in my series is '0'  is the void surrounding and boundaries again
the infinite 'number' in my series is '~' which represents chaos and order a quatium superposition of ~the meaning of life: everything and nothing at teh same time; 'Neverything'.
