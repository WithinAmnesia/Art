Player Group Sizes (Hybrid Number Sizes)



[50% Player Effectiveness Required For Average Player Group Size Rating; e.g. 6 Person Content Is Effectively 6 x 0.5 = 3 Average Player Effectiveness. One Level 300 Player Could In Theory Solo 6 Person Content As A Level 300 Player Could Have An Average Player Effectiveness Of 3.0; Where As 6 Person Content Requires 3.0 Average Player Effectiveness. Yet If a Level 300 Player Played with 1.5 Player Effectiveness a.k.a High Skill They Could Effectively Solo 9 Person Content Just Barely As ~ 1.5 x 300 = ~450 Averaeg Player Effectivness. For Level 100 9 Person Contnet Could Require An Average Player Effectiveness Of 450 As In Contnet Level (~'100') Divided In Half Or Times 0.5 Or ~'100' / 2 = ~'50. or ~'100' x 0.5 = ~'50'. Then Multiplied By The Content Person Size Of Say ~'9 Person Content'. 9 x (Level 100 x 0.5 = 50) = 450. Deity PLayers Could Solo 12 Person Content At Effective Player Level 300 + Item Level 400 + High Skill ~'1.5' Average Player Effectiveness. As In ~12 Person Level 100 Content Requires An Average Player Effectiveness Of (100 x 0.5 = 50) x 12 = 600, Player Level 300 + Item Level 400 is Effectively Level 400 Deity, Played With High Skill Of 1.5 Player Effectiveness = 400 x 1.5 = 600 Average Player Effectiveness. So In Theory A Deity Player Could Solo End Game 12 Person Content With High Skill.] 

Content Has No Player Amount Limits; Rather Difficulty Levels Scaled In ~'Average Player Effectiveness'. Multiple Player Content Should Be Designed To Require 0.5 Average Player Effectiveness Per Player In Order To Succeed. As In Average Group Rating / Size Divided By Half / Times 0.5 Equals The Average Player Effectiveness In Order To Succeed. For Example 12 Person Content Could Be 12 x 0.5 = 6, Or If 12 Players With 0.5 Average Player Effectiveness Encountered This Content They Should Be Able To Succeed; Yet Feel Challenged. Or 6 Players with 1.0 Average Player Effectiveness Should Be Able To Succeed; Yet Feel Challenged. This Hopefully Effectively Creates Skill Scaling Options As Well As Player Group Size Options In Order To Succeed At Various Player / Person Group Sizes / Rated Content. Hopefully Fulfilling Options Of Group Size And Player Skill Levels Towards Paths Of Success :-)!
