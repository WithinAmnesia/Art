----------------
1.) Medieval High Fantasy Colourful Universe of AGABAL [~'The Flagship Franchise']

2.) Semi-Historical Modern Warfare Beasts of Warfare

3.) Science Fiction Space Adventure Interstellar Fantasy

4.) Family Friendly Franchise Cartoon-y Arcade-y Worlds with Cartoon Dragon/Dinosaur platformer fun loving people.
