+++++Highest Total Roll Methods

Of these dice rolling methods to generate 6 attributes 3-18 what method generates the highest total roll on average?
Roll Prime Ability Score Attributes Systems:
0.) Roll 3D6 six time in Order (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, Charisma)
1.) Roll 3D6 six times in Order (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) [The Default Main Ability Score Ordering]
2.) Roll 3D6 six times in Order then make 12 characters and pick the 'best' 1 character.
3.) Roll 3D6 six times then choose to place the resulting ability scores where is 'best'.
4.) Roll 3d6 twice for each ability (rolling 12 times total), picking the higher total for each. Record in order.
5.) Roll 3d6 twelve times, then select the best six results and assign them to abilities in any order.
6.) Roll 4d6, drop the lowest die, and total the remaining three die. Do this six times and choose to assign the resulting ability scores in any order. (This is the most common "heroic" standard.)
7.) Roll 5d6, drop the two lowest dies, and total the remaining three die. Do this six times and choose to assign the resulting ability scores in any order. (This is a High-Powered Method.)
8.) Roll 3D6 six times for each ability in order. Repeat this for each ability and keep the highest score for each.To determine which method yields the highest total average across all six attributes, we look at the mathematical expected value (\(E\)) for a single score under each rolling mechanic. The average of a standard 3d6 roll is 10.5. Methods that involve "order" versus "assigning" do not change the mathematical sum of the attributes, only how optimal the character is for a specific class. Mathematical Comparison of Methods Method DescriptionAvg.

Mathematically, the probability of rolling a 15 or higher on 3d6 is about 9%. By doing it six times for one slot, you are statistically likely to have a very high number in almost every single category. Ranking the "High Powered" Methods If you are looking for the strongest characters, here is the hierarchy of the top three: Method 8 (85.6 total): This is extremely overpowered. You will rarely have a stat below 12, and most will be 15-18.Method 5 (~81.0 total): By taking the top 50% of 12 rolls, you effectively eliminate all "bad" rolls (anything below a 10 or 11).Method 7 (80.6 total): Using 5 dice to find the best 3 is very consistent and creates "superhuman" averages but is slightly edged out by the sheer volume of rolls in Method 5. A Note on Method 2 Note: For Method 2, the "best" character is subjective. If "best" means the highest sum of attributes, the average total is roughly 72-73. However, it feels lower than the others because you are still stuck with whatever internal distribution those 3d6 rolls produced for that specific character. Would you like me to calculate the specific probability of getting at least one 18 using your preferred method?  Creating a public link...You can now share this thread with othersHelpfulNot helpfulThank youYour feedback helps Google improve.

My answer: yes.ThinkingSearching Thinking a little longerTo calculate the probability of getting at least one 18, we first determine the probability of rolling a single 18 for each mechanic, then apply the "at least one" formula: \(1-(P(\text{failure}))^{n}\), where \(n\) is the total number of 3-die sets rolled. The method with the highest probability of producing at least one 18 is Method 2 (picking 1 character out of 12), with a 28.4% chance. Probability Breakdown by Method Method Total Rolls (3-die sets)Odds of a Single 18Prob. of at least one 180, 1, 36\(1/216\)2.75%4, 512\(1/216\)5.42%6 (4d6k3)6\(21/1296\)9.34%836\(1/216\)15.38%7 (5d6k3)6\(276/7776\)19.49%272\(1/216\)28.40%Analysis of the Results Sheer Volume Wins (Method 2): While Method 2 (3d6 in order, pick 1 of 12 characters) has lower average total stats than Method 8, it gives you the most "attempts" at a perfect 18. Since you are looking at 72 different attribute rolls (6 stats \(\times \) 12 characters), you have the highest mathematical likelihood of seeing a 18 somewhere in that pool.Quality over Quantity (Method 7): Even though you only roll 6 times in Method 7, the "5d6 drop 2" mechanic is so powerful (a 3.5% chance per stat vs 0.46% for 3d6) that it produces an 18 nearly 20% of the time.The "Heroic" Standard (Method 6): The common 4d6-drop-lowest method only yields an 18 about 9% of the time across a full character sheet. Comparison Table for Visualization ShareDownload✅ AnswerThe method with the highest probability of rolling at least one 18 is Method 2 (rolling 12 characters and picking the best), which results in a 28.4% chance.  Creating a public link...HelpfulNot helpfulThank youYour feedback helps Google improve.
