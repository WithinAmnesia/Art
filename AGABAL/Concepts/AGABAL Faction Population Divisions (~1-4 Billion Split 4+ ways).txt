I'm doing big thinking about the 4 factions ya how much each one gets of the ~ 1 billion. ~1,073,741,824 / 2^30

it seem the Covenant (not alliance) would be ~50-60-70% vs the Cabal (not horde) ~50-40-30% bu I gotta add in the 3rd faction of the Pact and it feels like it would be smaller than the Covenant and the Cabal but not by much. maybe (~1/3) ~33% Covenant, (~1/4) ~25% Cabal, (~1/5th) ~20% Pact? ... ~1/6th ~16-17% 4th Unaligned / Unliked faction? then like if you add that up that's only like ~1/20 left / 5% with no faction / other factions which might be like another 4 mini factions etc. then the 1% left is for another 4 micro factions like a Fibonacci spiral / golden ratio. infinite little bits at the end mhmm lol.

Thats a decent start I feel?
