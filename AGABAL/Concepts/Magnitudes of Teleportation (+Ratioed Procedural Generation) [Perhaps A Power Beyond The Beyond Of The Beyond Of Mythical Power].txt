Magnitudes of Teleportation (+Ratioed Procedural Generation) [Perhaps A Power Beyond The Beyond Of The Beyond Of Mythical Power]?



100 to 1 Ratio for Teleportation Energy

Teleportation requires a focused energy destination to ~successful cast. This can be made by a structure charged ~passively like an 'energy port'.
Yet a piece of this distint 'energy port' needs to accompy any casting object and or caster to ~successfully designate such a location to ~cast a ~usable teleportation spell portal.
Effectively this could be an object that is known as a 'teleportation object' and can be 'charged' and or used by a caster with a source of sufficient energy along with amount of skill to use the 'teleportation object'.

100 to 1 Ratio of Teleportation Cast Time Efficiency (Withdraw and Output)

10,000 Seconds of Actual Casting Time = 100 Seconds of Effective Casting Time = 1 Second of Teleportation of Self
100,000 Seconds of Actual Casting Time = 1,000 Seconds of Effective Casting Time = 10 Seconds of Teleportation of Other
1,000,000 Seconds of Actual Casting Time = 10,000 Seconds of Effective Casting Time = 100 Seconds of Teleportation of Others

1 to 1 Ratio of Teleportation Cast Time Efficiency (Withdraw and Output)

100 Seconds of Actual Casting Time = 100 Seconds of Effective Casting Time = 1 Second of Teleportation of Self
1,000 Seconds of Actual Casting Time = 1,000 Seconds of Effective Casting Time = 10 Seconds of Teleportation of Other
10,000 Seconds of Actual Casting Time = 10,000 Seconds of Effective Casting Time = 100 Seconds of Teleportation of Others


Casting With Aid

More people casting the same ~spell together in a 'ritual' combines the casting time. Example: 2 people casting ~together for 10 seconds = 20 seconds of Actual Casting Time. If One Caster is bad at castingb their total Effective Casting Time is added as is and is not averaged (more the marrier).


Some objects of varying quality / composition can 'hold' / 'store' a 'charge' / 'load' of Energy (commonly Spiritual and Magical).
There are ratios of 100 to 1 Ratio of Teleportation Cast / Discharge / Withdraw Time Efficiency.

100,000,000,000,000 to 1   1 Faulty
10,000,000,000,000 to 1    2 Flawed
1,000,000,000,000 to 1     3 Poor
100,000,000,000 to 1       4 Inferior
10,000,000,000 to 1        5 Weak
1,000,000,000 to 1         6 Minor
100,000,000 to 1           7 Lesser
10,000,000 to 1            8 Substantial / Medium / Regular / Stable / Default
1,000,000 to 1             9 Greater
100,000 to 1              10 Major
10,000 to 1               11 Mighty / Potent / Strong
1,000 to 1                12 Superior
100 to 1                  13 Supreme
10 to 1                   14 Transcendent
1 to 1                    15 Absolute

Note: Input effective cast time is 1:1 with the energy source of inputing 'charge' into the 'charge' 'holding' object. 'Easy' to Input, yet varying 'very bad to par' on Withdraw.

Again Cast Times can be combined in a 'ritual' / 'link' / 'connection' that adds the cast times together.

For Example: Withdraw
1,000 'linked' Faulty 'charge' 'holding' Object = Effectively on par with 1 Inferior 'charge' 'holding' Object.

For Example: Input
10 sources of energy / 'casting forces / casters' that cast 1 effective cast time per second (times 10 [for there are 10 of them together]),
focused on inputing energy into one 'charge' 'holding' object effective casting seconds would result in 1 x 10 = 10 effective cast time per second.

So in theory if there were 1,000,000 sources of energy / 'casting forces / casters' that cast 1 effective cast time per second focused on inputing energy,
into one Greater 'Charge' 'Holding' Object it would be charged for 1 second of effective cast / withdraw time per second.

This would naturaly lend economy of scale 'energy input infrastructure' arms race; for the larger the inputter more less quality 'charge' 'holding' objects can be effectively used.

With this system of 'easy input, very bad to par withdraw', most 'charge' 'holding' objects would naturally be of low to average quality thus creating a system of usage optimization;
either a less powerful Withdraw demanding energy output is used or vastly more power inputs are used.


Perhaps a power beyond Mythical Power? After combining 10 Absolute Quality 'Charge' 'Holding' Objects the Material Requirement Is Lifted; meaning travel to point to in a realm requires no piece of a distint 'energy port' to accompy any casting object and or caster.
Perhaps a power beyond the beyond of Mythical Power? After combining 100 Absolute Quality 'Charge' 'Holding' Objects the Destination Requirement Is Lifted; meaning travel to any point in a realm is possible, perhaps only just finding the most potent energy fonts; even hidden fonts.
Perhaps a power beyond the beyond of the beyond of Mythical Power? After combining 1,000 Absolute Quality 'Charge' 'Holding' Objects the Realm Requirement Is Lifted; meaning travel to any point in any realm is possible, perhaps only just finding the most potent energy fonts on any realm; even the Realm of Creator; Kronos. The Absolute Encounter: Avatar of Kronos?
