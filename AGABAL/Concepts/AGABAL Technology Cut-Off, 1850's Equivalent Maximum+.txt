AGABAL Technology Cut-Off, 1850's Equivalent Maximum

Medieval Technology, Spirit and Magical energies bounding and expanding economical realities and division of work and wealth.
Relevance for melee combat, plate armour, bows, crossbows, expensive / 'light' Spirit and Mana energies etc. A wonderous, willful, and wild world.
Use of Steam-power as an ~alternative to Spirit and Mana work.


'Niter' is 3 times less powerful for the AGABAL Universe than the real world 'Earth' equivalent:
Black Powder and Serpentine Powder is 3 times less power; effectively making real world 'Earth' Serpentine Powder as the highest mass produced gun propellant within AGABAL.
Nitroglycerin and similar 'modern' (1850's and before) military propellants and explosives are is 3 times less powerful for the AGABAL Universe than the real world 'Earth' equivalent.
No Smokeless Powder
No Internal Combustion Engine
