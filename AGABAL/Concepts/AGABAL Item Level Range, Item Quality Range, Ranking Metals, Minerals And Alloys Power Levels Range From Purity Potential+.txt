Lowest Purity Potential of all combining Metals, Minerals and Alloys is used when creating new Alloys. Example 75% Pure Copper combined with 90% Pure Tin = 75% Pure Bronze; resulting in Power Level 25 Bronze. 100% Pure Adamantium + 100% Quicksilver = 100% Pure Truegold; resulting in Power Level 260 Truegold.
