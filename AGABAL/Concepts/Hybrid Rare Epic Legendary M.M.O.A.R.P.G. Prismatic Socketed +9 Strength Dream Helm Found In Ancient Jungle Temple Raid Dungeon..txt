Have the dreams last night or this morning where it was like we're the warcraft and there's this helmet and it was kind of like this theme where there's a dab Bluetooth with these hybrid legendaries where there's this thing where the game had is this almost like things of the expired by the here's the kingdom kind of jungle maybe even Diablo 2 Jungle maybe even path eggs all jungle or sunken Temple kind of Indiana Jones kind of like mysterious Forest dungeon kind of thing and it was like this more of a larger scale area and it was kind of like there was this open almost like minor or Aztec kind of like the pyramid grounds kind of there was this like kind of rumor thing almost like it was a fake item but it was from developer was real and how these like these like 2000 like screenshot things that were like showing it it is the Helm of thousand needles model more or less but more like realistic looking kind of like a EverQuest concept art can only play a Keith Parkinson and stuff like that it's like a barbecue but it had like a crest that was like it might have been split it might have been together like Orcs without like the crest going horizontal and it was like spiked and it was like metal anyway it was the special but this is that it had this roll that was rare on the stats where it was I think it was a blue item or even purple and it had a prismatic gem socket that was a big deal it was a prismac gem socket with Plus 8 strength that was supposed to be the max that's what we rare but this one was a prismatic gem socket with plus nine strength and for this area of the game the progression that that's that meant a lot it was like the best like a mythical kind of shouldn't exist joke item in sense in like a one better than eight but I remember it's kind of neat how it felt it was ogres or something like that the ashbringer was this remember you get you got it from killing his ogres and something and it goes like you were Bashi or is all grub so like so zg (edited)Tuesday, 28 October 2025 13:35

It was I think potentially made by like hybrid numbers where he had to roll on top of roll or something that's a rare thing had a very marginal benefit but it was like I remember like the little Warcraft there was like whenever there is this thing where you have random stats like a suffix is always a chance for things to when multiple pieces have to come together stats they can kind of that's Clash like in the TBC classic like early launched with the crossbows of what I had too much stats so I remember also there was this bank we had this shirt where I could like move items around and I could basically chat my shirt and put it to chat plus like almost three on my shirt but it's basically is this a visual bug isn't that you can work but also there's other things I've ever and and cross wow there was like this I am the dropped that was like the suffixes about the tiger or something but it had like the stats were bugged on it so it was like stuff like that little mystery thing where it's advertised not to exist but it actually does like kind of like this in mystery the hybrid legendaries and August also Borderlands and also Diablo and a little chance it's kind of neat window like thing where it's say it's like it rolls where it's like 100 you get this extra bonus thing say it's like a like a you know and then all of a sudden on that roll it rolls 100 to get this extra little bonus thing so it's like neat when there's this these little things that stack together and unexpected ways that I think are cool where the main one might be like the Prismatic jam with the Plus 8 strength and that's like if you get like the the Jam Plus something but if you have like a thing where it's like the maybe like two things get together maybe maybe like somehow double roll something like those like this double legendaries that smushed together something like in Diablo 2

so it's like I yeah it might be an it feels like someone planned where you had this like very rare occurrence where he seems to put together but after that and also my my game sends what is neat that my mind is always using like different things how they felt and games to try to get this this feeling together was very like Smooth crisp like vanilla bean ice cream feeling

I also remember the people were like ooh that's crazy it shouldn't exist but like it would be okay if like you had I think it's like where I I do in MMORPGs it's like 1 and 50th 1.5 the limit so if you have that's like 150 and then it's like the odds could be where that you have it where it's like if you stack them like I wouldn't want it so that 1.5% chance that another 1.5% chance that's like 1 and 2,500 that's a bit like degenerate but it's like it also too if things are locked behind like rolling numbers it gets like a bit like but it's nice to have extra things where the extra rare so also with crafting being so prominent wincraft almost everything in a sense it's like I guess you'd be like rare chance say if you like doing like nanoparticles they all align a certain way it's a little chance we could so it's like yeah I guess you could someone else it's hard to call but maybe like a perfect diamond I guess so you can hear you see if you have like a very low chance to create something that is without Flaws by just doing a certain process which usually inherently has flaws but maybe that's what the Prismatic Diamond thing right like if you like how it would kind of like you know like that's this but it ends up having this bonus with the facts. It just things all lined up or doesn't of faults and is where you got lucky on like like six or eight different separate things that go into it that normally you have a joke like rolling a character stop I suppose starting I guess you'd be like if you will yeah cuz I couldn't make sense can be like 60 minutes and then you can have an average when you expected then there's a very low chance I guess you could also well something has made in its initial stage you can't like usually upgraded I guess you could like reheat it I don't know just yeah I guess initial creation bonus will be there something to think about I guess.
