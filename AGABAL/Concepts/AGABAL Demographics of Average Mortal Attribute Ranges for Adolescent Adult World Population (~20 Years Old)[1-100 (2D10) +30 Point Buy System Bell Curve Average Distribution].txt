AGABAL Demographics of Average Mortal Attribute Ranges for Adolescent Adult World Population (~20 Years Old)[1-100 +30 Point Buy System Average Distribution].
(Adolescent being ~10-19 Years Old and Adult being 20+ Years Old):

~5-15% or ~10% or ~1/10th (or up to 1/6th [~16.7% ] to 1/4th [~25%]) of people are trades people by world population.
~20-50 or ~33.3% or ~1/3rd (or up to 2/5ths [~40%] or 1/2nd [~50%]) of people have played a musical instrument by world population.
~40-70% or ~50-60% or ~55% ~11/20ths (or up to ~2/3rds [~66.7%] or 11/20ths to 4/5ths [~55-80% (55+80=135, 135/2=~67.5%)]) of people consider themselves creative (with ~5% saying they are not creative); so about more than half of people are creative by world population.

1-100+30 Point Buy System Average Attribute Statistic Distribution Range:

1 + 100 = 101 / 2 = ~50.5 x 6 = ~303 + 30 = ~333 / 6 = ~55.5 = 56 x 3 + 55 x 3 = ~333 Average Attribute Statistic Distribution Range.

~2/3 to ~67.5% of beings are physical.

World Population Demographics Of Average Attribute Statistic Distribution Range For Adolescent Adult (~20 Years Old):

56 + 15 = ~71 Strength
56 + 7 = ~63 Agility
56 + 4 = ~60 Constitution
55 + 2 = ~57 Perception
55 + 1 = ~56 Intelligence
55 + 1 = ~56 Charisma

30 / 2 = 15 (15) [+15 Strength] / 2 = 7.5 (7) [+7 Agility] / 2 = 3.75 (4) [+4 Constitution] / 2 = 1.875 (2) [+2 Perception] / 2 = 0.9375 (1) [+1 Intelligence] / 2 = 0.46875 (1) [+1 Charisma]

(It could be +15, +8, +4, +2, +1, +0 but it kinda sucks to have Charisma be a dump stat again in spirit. I've tried to make it useful or at least on pair with any of the attribution statistics 
to make the universe of AGABAL more full and representive of reality of at least try to in a way. S.A.C.P.I.C. is meant to be a more or less semi-balanced or fully fleshed out way to model 
a version of reality. Also to give life and a sustainable structure or work to realize the realities of the history, culture and player expectations and general fun of 
MMORPGS / RPGs / World History in general for adventuring with the a world worth exploring, playing and experiencing!)

6x1-100+30(Point Buy) [6 x 1-100 (6 x 2D10) + 30 Hybrid Point Buy Bell Curve Averaged Random Odds System

After doing the math the bell curve only affects multiple sets of dice and the law of averages over 1,000,000+ dice rolls averages out any bias in the sequential 2d10 dice rolls effectively making the 2d10 percentile dice rolling system 99.9%+ similar in odds to just rolling a 1d100.
If the 6 Attribute Statistics are rolled together and the order of the stats are able to be swapped but not the raw base values with point buy attributes added on top of the base 1-100 values then this can generate a modified bell curve and also allow creatures to be generated with averaged random bell curve odd values and also have creatures be able to favour attributes and raising to 100 maximum the character creation stat value and having the stat value floor minimum be the rolled base value.
This would act as rolling attribute statistics that 5 are all all rolled at once generating bell curve averaged random value odds and the creature can have these base values swapped / assigned to preferred attributes and then the 30 point buy attribute point statistics can be added like an adjustable hybrid system ontop of the static but rearangable base attribute statistics and then the 30 point buy stat points can be added to adjust and favor some states over others. This can make some select attributes be maxed to 100 at level 1 with 70+ base attribute roll and making 70+ rolls valuable.
The maximum attributes are not limited to 100 in total but they are the base range for Mortality of 1-100 but can be increased beyonf for 101-200 for Immortals and 300 etc for more higher levels of divine power progression / creature levels. If a creature has bad stats it is a starting penalty and can be evened out in spirit so in the end by around level 100 progression a creature can increase the values of attributes if desired to 100 in every base attribute with enough effort. This same spirit / logic allpies to higher level creature divine power progression.
In theory a creature could start with 1 in every base attribute and have 30 point buy attribute points added to make 6 x 1 = 6 + 30 = 36 as the minimum attribute statistic total points range at level 1 and by level 300 they could earn in theory 6 x 400 = 2,400 attribute statistics points for thebase attributes of the creature character with more possibly added as added bonuses such as buffs, and equipment but this is in spirit and there may be soft or logical limits to this but 6 x 400 base attributes should intheory be possible for all creature characters even if the progression is quite extensive in game time and or world building.
